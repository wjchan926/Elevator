===Lab 1: Elevator Simulation===
Created by: Wesley Chan
IDE: Eclipse Neon
Java Version 8

==Description==
There are 7 .java files associated with this package.
There are 2 input .txt files associated with this package for testing purposes.
There are2 sample output .txt files for reference.
The input and output files are located in the ...\Elevator\ folder.

The original .txt input file provided to the students is named elevatorDataOriginal.txt
The second input file is student generated data for testing purposes.


==How to Use==
The Driver file that includes the main() method is named ElevatorDriver.java.

The driver accepts 2 commandline arguments.  The first argument is the input data source file.
The second arugment will be the name of the output source file.
Include extensions in the filename strings.

If a user wishes to use their own data, please refer to the =Input Data Format= section.
The user file must be in the same folder as the other input files.
Do not add the file extension when typing in the filename.

When the Driver has completed the simulation, the output file will be in the same folder as the input files.

Sample Output has been generated from the input file elevatorDataOriginal.txt for reference.
The sample output file is called OriginalOutput.txt

Sample Output has been generated from the input file (studentGenData).for reference.
The sample output file is called studentOutput.txt


==Input Data Format==
The first 2 lines of the input file are for information only.
The program will ignore these 2 lines.

The following data lines are organized as: the name followed by the entrance floor, followed by the exit floor.
